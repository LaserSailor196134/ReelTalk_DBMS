Kai's devlog.

- ssl verification was circumvented for cURL request in movies.php.
- api request works properly, still needs to be made to request the extra info we want. - DONE
- html needs to be modified to match site. - DONE
- cast and crew search needs to be done. Should be easy once I finish movie, basically the same. - DONE
- tv shows may take longer, since they kinda different and may need modifications on frontend. Problem for later.
- bookmark also needs doing, but that can wait till other tasks are done, and will need to coordinate with users.
- url modification functionality added for Michael - DONE
- info then needs to be placed in moviesdb. - DONE
- crossfunctionality for api pull still needs to be done, there is code for it in movies.php but it does not work.
- truncated character pull to not cause errors with VARCHAR
- frontend still needs to be cleaned up visually.
- frontend page opening with info needs to be implemented.
