Kai's devlog.

- ssl verification was circumvented for cURL request in movies.php.
- api request works properly, still needs to be made to request the extra info we want. 
- html needs to be modified to match site.
- cast and crew search needs to be done. Should be easy once I finish movie, basically the same.
- tv shows may take longer, since they kinda different and may need modifications on frontend. Problem for later.
- bookmark also needs doing, but that can wait till other tasks are done, and will need to coordinate with users.
